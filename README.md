The following projects have been coded in Python
They are a set of Beginner's OpenGl projects as part of my course work.

I'm posting my code here hoping it'll help people who'r working on OpenGL in Python as most of the resources out there have the the sames labs in C++.
Hoping you'll find this helpfull.

Happy Coding :)
